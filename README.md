# Zemoga - Mobile Test 

Mobile application created with react-native, shows a list of publications obtained from a jsonplaceholder. 
To persist the data implement realm as a mobile database.


For the interface components implement native-base, it is a powerful library easy to implement and flexible to customize.I decided to use this library because it provides the components I needed, the previous experience, and it is easy to use. 

The structure of the project is distributed in containers and components of type "functional components" written in typescript to take advantage of the benefits of the same as its typing.
